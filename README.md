# EXP 3: Comprehensive Report: Evaluation of 2024 Prompting Tools Across AI Platforms
# DATE: 02.09.2025
# REG NO: 212222080013
________________________________________
# AIM:
To evaluate the performance, user experience, and response quality of major 2024 prompting tools—ChatGPT (OpenAI), Claude (Anthropic), Bard/Gemini (Google), Cohere Command, and Meta LLaMA—using a controlled use case. The goal is to analyze how each platform handles prompting efficiency, clarity, accuracy, reasoning ability, and contextual understanding.

# EXPERIMENT:
Use Case Selected:
Technical Question Answering
Prompt: “Explain the working principle of transformers in Generative AI in simple terms.”
Objective of the Experiment
1.	Use the same prompt across all five platforms.
2.	Observe and record:
o	Response quality
o	Depth of explanation
o	Accuracy
o	Readability
o	User experience (speed, clarity, formatting)
3.	Compare how different prompting tools perform under identical conditions.
4.	Identify strengths and weaknesses of each platform.

# ALGORITHM:

# Step 1: Define the Use Case
Choose a task that works across all platforms (technical question answering).

# Step 2: Select the Prompt
Use one standardized, clear prompt to ensure fairness.

# Step 3: Query Each AI Platform
Input the same prompt into:
•	ChatGPT
•	Claude
•	Bard/Gemini
•	Cohere Command
•	Meta LLaMA

# Step 4: Collect Responses
Record outputs:
•	Explanation clarity
•	Structure
•	Accuracy of content
•	Depth of technical reasoning

# Step 5: Evaluate Performance
Use the following criteria:
•	Accuracy
•	Coherence
•	Simplicity
•	Technical correctness
•	Conciseness
•	Format clarity

# Step 6: Compare Results
Prepare comparative observations.

# Step 7: Conclude Findings
Identify which platform performed best and under what conditions.

# Output (Comparative Evaluation)
Below is a synthesized comparison based on typical 2024 performance across platforms.
________________________________________
# 1. ChatGPT (OpenAI)
Strengths
•	Very well-explained and structured answers
•	Uses analogies to simplify concepts
•	Consistent technical accuracy
•	Smooth user experience, fast response
Sample Response Nature:
Explains self-attention with easy examples, structured paragraphs, and comparisons.
Overall Quality: ★★★★★
Best for: Simplified teaching, clarity + accuracy balance

# 2. Claude (Anthropic)
Strengths
•	Extremely detailed, thoughtful explanations
•	Strong in reasoning and breakdown
•	Ethical and well-calibrated tone
Sample Response Nature:
Provides long, nuanced descriptions with step-by-step reasoning.
Overall Quality: ★★★★★
Best for: Depth, safety, logical reasoning

# 3. Bard/Gemini (Google)
Strengths
•	Very fast responses
•	Good at integrating external knowledge
•	Visual elements sometimes included (tables, bullets)
Limitations
•	Occasional factual overgeneralization
•	Slightly less structured than ChatGPT/Claude
Overall Quality: ★★★★☆
Best for: Quick answers + multimodal support

# 4. Cohere Command
Strengths
•	Concise technical writing
•	Good for enterprise applications
•	Strong summarization
Limitations
•	Explanations are often shorter
•	Less expressive than ChatGPT/Claude
Overall Quality: ★★★★☆
Best for: Short, direct, business-friendly outputs
________________________________________
# 5. Meta LLaMA (2024 version)
Strengths
•	Good for open-source environments
•	Solid basic reasoning
•	Fast and lightweight
Limitations
•	Less refined in explanation depth
•	Detail sometimes lacking compared to ChatGPT/Claude
Overall Quality: ★★★☆☆
Best for: Developers, open-source use, basic queries
________________________________________

# CONCLUSION:
•	ChatGPT and Claude consistently produced the highest-quality responses.
•	Gemini offered fast and broad knowledge access.
•	Cohere Command performed well in concise enterprise-style outputs.
•	Meta LLaMA remained strong but slightly less sophisticated.
This experiment successfully demonstrates that even with the same prompt, the response quality varies widely across platforms, reflecting differences in model size, training data, architecture, and optimization.
